Hoffman"],"categories":[],"content":"When designing an fluorescent microscope (or general optical system) one often wants to scan the beam position and/or angle at the sample (or object plane). It\u0026rsquo;s useful to remember that for any lens, especially for objective lenses, the back pupil plane is Fourier conjugate to the sample (object) plane of the lens.1 This has two important consequences for system design.\n A beam that is focused in the back pupil will be collimated at the object plane and vice versa. For instance, if you completely fill the back pupil of an objective with light (preferably overfilling it) then you will have a diffraction limited spot at the sample plane.2 If the beam enters the back pupil at an angle relative to the optical axis the position at the sample plane will be shifted relative to the optical axis.  Basically: angle in the back pupil is position at the object plane and position in the back pupil is angle at the object plane.\nScanning the beam position We can make a simple geometrical argument for this case (see figure above). The most important ray here is the chief ray (solid orange line) which passes through the center of the lens, the marginal rays (dashed orange lines) have been added for clarity. In this case we imagine a collimated beam of light entering the back aperture of an aplanatic lens at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the optical axis. The collimated (parallel) rays converge at the focal plane a distance $f$ away from the lens forming a spot at a perpendicular distance $y$ from the optical axis. We can relate these quantities together with the following equation based solely on geometrical reasoning:\n$$ y = f \\tan \\theta $$\nFor simple lenses and large angles this equation doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold. But for specially designed optical systems, particularly scan lenses which are designed to specifically for this task, it can hold for very large angles and therefore fields of view.\nScanning the beam angle Here we take a slightly different approach. We know that if we were to launch a ray parallel to the optical axis from the very edge of the objective\u0026rsquo;s back pupil then the ray exiting the front of the objective would make an angle $\\theta$ with the optical axis such that $NA = n \\sin \\theta_{max}$ (the classic equation for numerical aperture). That means that if the ray were launched a distance $y$ from the optical axis that was less than half the pupil diameter we could define an effective NA as $NA_{eff} = y / f$ where $f$ is the focal length of the lens. We can derive this equation knowing that the pupil diameter is $D = 2 NA f$. This means we can solve for $\\theta$ as a function of $y$.\n$$ \\theta = \\sin^{-1} \\left(\\frac{y}{fn}\\right) $$\nWhy aren\u0026rsquo;t the two equations the same? I was surprised that these two equations would be different. The best explanation I can come up with is that for a well corrected, high magnification, system (such as a microscope objective) the entrance pupil (the pupil facing the object) is curved (in fact it lies on part of a spherical shell) while the exit pupil (the pupil facing infinity space) is flat.\n  I\u0026rsquo;ll use sample plane and object plane interchangeably throughout. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Approximately $\\sigma\u0026rsquo; \\sigma = \\frac{\\lambda f}{\\pi}$ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1583959591,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584076033,"objectID":"c6a935aa17d3f55dfff2ef36335dbc35","permalink":"https://david-hoffman.github.io/post/angle-to-position-and-back/","publishdate":"2020-03-11T13:46:31-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/angle-to-position-and-back/","section":"post","summary":"The back pupil plane of a microscope objective is Fourier conjugate to it's image plane.

In the frequency domain, five FSRS peaks are observed with frequencies of 534, 858, 1069, 1392, and 1926 cm$^{–1}$. The most intense peaks at 534 and 1392 cm$^{–1}$ correspond to fundamentals while the features at 858, 1069, and 1926 cm$^{–1}$ are attributed to a difference frequency, an overtone and a combination frequency of the fundamentals, respectively. The frequency of the 1392 cm$^{–1}$ fundamental corresponding to the central C═C stretch of TCNE•– is red-shifted from the frequency of the steady state radical due to the close proximity and electron affinity of the countercation. The observation of a FSRS band at a difference frequency is analyzed. This analysis lends evidence for alternative nonlinear pathways of inverse Raman gain scattering (IRGS) or vertical-FSRS (VFSRS) which may contribute to the time-evolving FSRS spectrum on-resonance. Impulsive stimulated Raman measurements of the complex show coherent oscillations of the stimulated emission with frequencies of 153, 278, and 534 cm$^{–1}$. The 278 cm$^{–1}$ mode corresponds to Cl bending of the dichloromethane solvent. The center frequency of the 278 cm$^{–1}$ mode is modulated by a frequency of ∼30 cm$^{–1}$ which is attributed to the effect of librational motion of the dichloromethane solvent as it reorganizes around the nascent contact ion pair. The 153 ± 15 cm$^{–1}$ mode corresponds to an out-of-plane bending motion of TCNE. This motion modulates the intermolecular separation of the contact ion pair and thereby the overlap of the frontier orbitals which is crucial for rapid charge recombination in 5.9 ± 0.2 ps.

These oscillations in vibrational properties are due to anharmonic couplings between the high frequency finger print modes and the impulsively driven low frequency molecular distortions in the excited state. The largest anharmonic couplings, with intrinsic oscillation magnitudes of up to 40 cm$^{–1}$, are observed between the 467 cm$^{–1}$ C–C bend and the 1333 cm$^{–1}$ C–C stretch with the 191 cm$^{–1}$ methyl wag, all of which are centered on the reactive cyclohexadiene moiety.

I have used femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) to probe these transformations with structural specificity and high time precision revealing the mechanisms of two important classes of reactions; isomerization about an N=N bond and interfacial/intermolecular electron transfer. Isomerization about a double bond is one of the simplest, yet most important, photochemical reactions. In contrast to carbon double bonds, nitrogen double bonds can react via two possible mechanisms; rotation or inversion. To determine which pathway is predominant, I studied an azobenzene derivative using both FSRS and impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy (ISRS). The FSRS experiments demonstrated that the photochemical reaction occurs concomitantly with the 700 fs non-radiative decay of the excited state; because no major change in N=N stretching frequency was measured, I surmised that the reaction proceeds through an inversion pathway. My subsequent ISRS experiments confirmed this hypothesis; I observed a highly displaced, low frequency, inversion-like mode, indicating that initial movement out of the Franck-Condon region proceeds along an inversion coordinate. To probe which nuclear motions facilitate electron transfer and charge recombination, I used FSRS and the newly developed 2D-FSRS techniques to study two model systems, triphenylamine dyes bound to TiO2 nanoparticles and a molecular charge transfer (CT) dimer. In the dye-nanoparticle system I discovered that charge separation persists much longer ( 100 ps) than previously thought by using the juxtaposition of the FSRS and transient absorption data to separate the dynamics of the dye from that of the injected electron. Additionally, I discovered that dye constructs with an added vinyl group were susceptible to quenching via isomerization. The CT dimer offered an opportunity to study a system in which charge recombination occurred on a shorter timescale (~10 ps). Here I found that impulsively excited coherent nuclear motion in the excited state survived for more than 5 ps. These long lived coherences enabled the performance of 2D-FSRS to identify the coupling and tuning modes of the conical intersection that connects the charge transfer excited state with the neutral ground state and therefore the nuclear motions responsible for charge recombination. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that the photochemical reactivity is not mediated by phase-space randomization but rather by specific, coherent, nuclear trajectories. In this thesis I have demonstrated the power and utility of FSRS in probing condensed phase chemical reaction dynamics and provided a glimpse of the capabilities of 2D-FSRS. In general, 2D-FSRS provides a direct measure of the anharmonic coupling that controls reactivity. Looking forward, higher time resolution (broader band) 2D-FSRS will open up a whole new approach for characterizing transition states and energy transfer processes.","tags":[],"title":"PhD Thesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David P.

Despite many studies, the molecular details of their light induced trans to cis isomerization are still debated. To inform this discussion we probed the low frequency skeletal motions in an azobenzene derivative, 4-nitro-4′-dimethylamino-azobenzene (NDAB), with resonant impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy (RISRS). Four previously unobserved modes at 14, 47, 150, and 201 cm$^{–1}$ were found. Of these, the ∼50 cm$^{–1}$ inversion motion and the ∼15 cm$^{–1}$ torsional motion had particularly large intensities, suggesting that the excited state potential energy surface is steeply sloped along these coordinates in the Franck–Condon region. These data support a model in which NDAB isomerizes predominantly along a prompt inversion coordinate as well as a slower torsional motion that mitigates the phenyl–phenyl interactions on the pathway to the isomerized product.","tags":["ultrafast"],"title":"Ndab Isrs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David P.

The time asymmetric profile of the etalon-generated pulse is shown to be responsible for both of these observations. A theoretical discussion is presented which quantitatively supports this hypothesis. It is concluded that etalons are the ideal method for the generation of narrowband ps pulses for FSRS because of the optical simplicity, efficiency, improved FSRS intensity and reduced backgrounds.","tags":["ultrafast"],"title":"Etalon Fsrs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David P.

To address this problem, we have used transient absorption (TA) and femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) to investigate the photoexcited dynamics of a series of triphenylamine–coumarin dye/TiO2 conjugates. The TA decay is multiexponential, spanning time scales from 100 fs to 100 ps, while the characteristic transient Raman spectrum of the radical cation decays biexponentially with a dominant ∼3 ps component. To explain these observations, we propose a model in which the decay of the TA is due to hot electrons migrating from surface trap states to the conduction band of TiO2 while the decay of the Raman signature is due to internal conversion of the dye molecule. Furthermore, the S1 Raman spectrum of TPAC3, a dye wherein a vinyl group separates the triphenylamine and coumarin moieties, is similar to the S1 Raman spectrum of trans-stilbene; we conclude that their S1 potential energy surfaces and reactivity are also similar. This correlation suggests that dyes containing vinyl linkers undergo photoisomerization that competes with electron injection.","tags":["ultrafast"],"title":"Dye Sensitized Fsrs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David P.

Key marker modes, such as the 1570/1590 cm$^{–1}$ NO2 stretch and the 1630 cm$^{–1}$ C–N(Me)2 stretch, enable the separation and analysis of distinct trans and cis photoproduct dynamics revealing the 400 fs Frank-Condon relaxation, the 800 fs timescale of the cis product formation and the 2 ps emergence and 8 ps relaxation of the unsuccessful ground state trans species. Based on these observations, we propose a reaction mechanism, including initial dilation of the CNN bend later joined by quick movement along the CCNN, CNNC and NNCC torsional coordinates that constitutes a mixed inversion-rotation mechanism.","tags":["ultrafast"],"title":"Ndab","type":"publication"}]
